PROCYON

	When Procyon was found, it had been a lonely place for many millenia. 
	To the amazement of many, the station was in excellent condition: 
	the lights were burning, the machines where humming.

	Despite the objections of the Earth Alliance military, 
	a convoy of colonists was send to establish a permanent base. 

	Unfortunatly, they soon found out why the station was 
	abandoned in the first place.....

SOURCE

	With this final release I included the source .map file in the .pk3.
	Please note that Procyon is slighty broken, there are a few very evil
	brushes in the waterway, and who knows where else. In this state it is 
	a few hundred edges below MAX_EDGE_LINES.

	I compiled the map with the following settings:
	
	q3map2 -bsp -custinfoparms -samplesize 8 -meta 
	q3map2 -vis -saveprt 
	q3map2 -light -scale 1.1 -fast -v -shade -patchshadows -super 2 -samples 3 -bounce 5

	Note: this will need +1G RAM and a takes a couple of hours to compile.

	If you release a modified version of procyon, do NOT use the original filename.
	You can call it map-procyon-myversion or give it a totally different name. 
	
	If you only need to change the default base location,
	search the Tremulous forum for Risujin-Avenger's mod (aka "Balance Light") 
	and use the !layout command.
